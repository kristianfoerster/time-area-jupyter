# Time-area diagram and the unit hydrograph

Author: Kristian Förster

This repository includes a [Jupyter notebook](Time-area-diagram.ipynb) that demonstrates the theory underlying the time-area diagram and the unit hydrograph. Together with a tutorial with active student involvment (see Schulz et al., 2018), this Jupyter notebook is provided as teaching material in the course "Urban Hydrology" at Leibniz Universität Hannover.
